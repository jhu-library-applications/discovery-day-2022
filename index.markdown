Welcome to the Ivy Plus Libraries Discovery Day virtual conference for 2022. This year, the conference will include our usual round-robin presentations from each member library, followed by a few knowledge sharing sessions to be selected by the attendees unconference style.  

The conference will take place via Zoom, with each session on a different day, spread out over several weeks.
