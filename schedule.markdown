## Vote for Topical Sessions
Tricider allows you to propose and vote for ideas. Please use it to propose and vote for the sessions you would like to see at Discovery Day this year. Tricider does not require you to set up an account in order to vote. The planning committee will schedule virtual meetings for the two or three topics that garner the most votes.
